      <h3>The World of Fender Guitars</h3>
      <div class="special-section2">
        <p>
          Fender was founded in 1946 and created the Telecaster, which is known as the first mass produced solid-body electric guitar. The stratocaster came soon after, which is the most recognizable and influential electric guitar in hisotry. 
          Fender has remained to be one of the most trusted guitar manufacturers, and has also become the creators of some of the greatest amplifiers as well. Fender is not constrained to one genre, with players using their instruments to go in a variety of ranges. 
          Some other famous models are the Jazzmaster, Mustang, Jaguar, along with the Precision, and Jazz bass.
